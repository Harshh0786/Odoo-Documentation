#### POS Screens

In the Odoo Point of Sale (POS) system, the frontend typically consists of several key screens that facilitate different aspects of the sales process. The main screens include:

1. **Product Screen**: Displays the available products for selection. It often includes categories and a search feature for easy navigation.

2. **Payment Screen**: Used for processing payments. It provides options for different payment methods such as cash, card, and more.

3. **Order Summary Screen:** Shows a summary of the items added to the order, along with the total amount, discounts, and taxes.

4. **Customer Screen:** Allows the user to select or add customer information to the order.

5. **Receipt Screen:** Displays the final receipt details after the payment is processed, and usually provides an option to print or email the receipt.

6. **Settings Screen:** Allows the user to configure various POS settings such as user preferences, payment methods, and hardware devices.

7. **Order Management Screen:** Used to manage ongoing and completed orders, including viewing, editing, and refunding orders.

8. **Login Screen**: Where users log in to access the POS system, often featuring user authentication options.

These screens work together to provide a seamless and efficient sales experience for both the staff and the customers.

#### Backend of POS

In the backend of an Odoo Point of Sale (POS) system, several key models are typically used to manage various aspects of the POS functionality. Here are some of the main models commonly used:

1. **pos.order**: Represents an order created in the POS, containing information about products, quantities, prices, taxes, and discounts applied.

2. **pos.config**: Configuration settings for each POS session, including information about the point of sale location, payment methods available, and other session-specific settings.

3. **product.product**: Represents products available for sale in the POS, including details like name, price, category, and stock information.

4. **res.partner**: Represents customers who can be associated with POS orders. It stores details like name, contact information, and address.

5. **account.journal**: Defines the different payment methods accepted in the POS, such as cash, credit card, or vouchers.

6. **stock.quant**: Manages the stock quantities of products in different locations, ensuring accurate inventory management in the POS.

7. **pos.session**: Tracks the sessions of the POS terminal, including open and close times, user sessions, and sales statistics for each session.

These models work together to facilitate the entire POS workflow, from managing products and customers to processing orders, payments, and inventory updates. Depending on the customization and specific requirements of the POS implementation, additional models or custom fields within these models may also be used.

#### synchronization between the frontend and backend for pos.order

In Odoo POS setup, synchronization mechanisms between the frontend (JavaScript) and the backend (Python)  is achieved through the methods `init_from_JSON`, `export_as_JSON`, and `export_for_printing` in pos.order model

##### 1. `init_from_JSON(json)`

##### Purpose:
The `init_from_JSON` method is used to initialize an object's properties from JSON data received from the backend. In your case, it initializes `discount_applied`, `custom_note`, and `location` fields of an `Order` object.

##### Implementation:
```javascript
//@override
init_from_JSON(json) {
    super.init_from_JSON(...arguments);
    this.discount_applied = json.discount_applied || false;
    this.custom_note = json.custom_note || "";
    this.location = json.location || "";
}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `super.init_from_JSON(...arguments);`: Calls the superclass's (base class) `init_from_JSON` method, ensuring any base initialization is performed.
  - `this.discount_applied = json.discount_applied || false;`: Initializes `discount_applied` with the value from JSON, defaulting to `false` if not provided.
  - `this.custom_note = json.custom_note || "";`: Initializes `custom_note` with the value from JSON, defaulting to an empty string if not provided.
  - `this.location = json.location || "";`: Initializes `location` with the value from JSON, defaulting to an empty string if not provided.

##### Example Usage:
Suppose you receive the following JSON data from the backend:

```json
{
  "discount_applied": true,
  "custom_note": "Handle with care",
  "location": "Store A"
}
```

Using `init_from_JSON`, you initialize an `Order` object in your frontend JavaScript:

```javascript
const order = new Order();
order.init_from_JSON({
  "discount_applied": true,
  "custom_note": "Handle with care",
  "location": "Store A"
});

console.log(order.discount_applied); // true
console.log(order.custom_note); // "Handle with care"
console.log(order.location); // "Store A"
```

##### 2. `export_as_JSON()`

##### Purpose:
The `export_as_JSON` method prepares the current state of an `Order` object to be sent as JSON data to the backend. It includes `discount_applied`, `custom_note`, and `location` fields.

##### Implementation:
```javascript
//@override
export_as_JSON() {
    const json = super.export_as_JSON(...arguments);
    if (json) {
        json.discount_applied = this.discount_applied;
        json.custom_note = this.custom_note;
        json.location = this.location;
    }
    return json;
}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `super.export_as_JSON(...arguments);`: Calls the superclass's (base class) `export_as_JSON` method to get the base JSON data.
  - Adds `discount_applied`, `custom_note`, and `location` fields to the JSON object (`json`) based on the current state of the `Order` object.

##### Example Usage:
Suppose you have an `Order` object in your frontend JavaScript with updated data:

```javascript
const order = new Order();
order.setCustomNote("Urgent: Rush delivery required.");
order.setDiscountApplied();
order.location = "Store B";

const jsonData = order.export_as_JSON();
console.log(jsonData);
```

The `jsonData` object will contain:

```json
{
  "discount_applied": true,
  "custom_note": "Urgent: Rush delivery required.",
  "location": "Store B"
}
```

This JSON data can then be sent to the backend for processing or storage.

##### 3. `export_for_printing()`

##### Purpose:
The `export_for_printing` method prepares data of an `Order` object specifically for printing, including `custom_note` and `location` fields.

##### Implementation:
```javascript
//@override
export_for_printing() {
    const result = super.export_for_printing(...arguments);
    result.custom_note = this.custom_note;
    result.location = this.location;
    return result;
}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `super.export_for_printing(...arguments);`: Calls the superclass's (base class) `export_for_printing` method to get the base printable data (`result`).
  - Adds `custom_note` and `location` fields to the `result` object based on the current state of the `Order` object.

##### Example Usage:
Suppose you have an `Order` object ready for printing in your frontend JavaScript:

```javascript
const order = new Order();
order.setCustomNote("Customer prefers no onions.");
order.setDiscountApplied();
order.location = "Store C";

const printData = order.export_for_printing();
console.log(printData);
```

The `printData` object will contain:

```json
{
  // Base printing data from superclass
  "subtotal": 100,
  "total": 90,

  // Custom fields for printing
  "custom_note": "Customer prefers no onions.",
  "location": "Store C"
}
```

This `printData` can then be used to generate a printable version of the order.

##### Summary

- **`init_from_JSON`**: Initializes an `Order` object with data received from the backend JSON.
- **`export_as_JSON`**: Prepares current state of `Order` object for sending updates to backend as JSON.
- **`export_for_printing`**: Prepares data of `Order` object specifically for printing purposes.
