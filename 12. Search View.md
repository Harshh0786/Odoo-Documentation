Search view are different from other views because search views will not display the content and it is used to filter the contents of other views rather than form views, Because
form view consist of a single record so there is no need for any search view.

In search view we can add the field names for the search for something that is available in the view then we get the result based on the corresponding field name.

```xml
<record id='view_event_event_search' model='ir.ui.view'>
	<field name='name'>event.event.search</field>
	<field name='model'>event.event</field>
	<field name='arch' type='xml'>
		<search>
			<field name='name'/>
			<field name='location'/>
			<field name='guest_ids'/>
			<field name='type'/>
		</search>
	</field>
</record>
```

In search view default is or condition if you want to apply '**and**' condition **`<separator/>`**

#### Filter & Group By

We also have the options filters & group by in the search view we can filter & also group the records by the fields of the corresponding model. if we check these options then we can see all the filter corresponding to model. we can also choose add custom filter or custom group inside search tag after field we can add filter & group by.

```xml
<filter name='filter_status' string='paid' domain="[('status','=','paid')]"/>

<filter name='fitler_kids' string='kids' domain="[('age'.'&lt;=',14)]"/>
```

(<=) -> (`&lt;=`)           (>=) -> (`&gt;=`)

---
#### Group By

```xml
<group expand='0' string='group by'>
	<filter string='gender' name='group_by_gender'
			context="{'group_by':'gender'}"/>
</group>
```

In context attribute on which field you want to apply group by that we define expand attribute means if you set `expand='0'` first search view is displayed the content of this group will not be shown users have to manually expand the group by clicking on to see its content

`expand='1'` means the group will be intially expanded means the content of the group will be immeditaly visible without the need for users to manually expand it.
