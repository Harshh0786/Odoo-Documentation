The odoo server provides xml/json based on external API that's used by odoo's web client and is also available for other client applications . so here web client can perform some crud operation.

#### Diagram of XML - RPC
![[XML-RPC Diagram.png]]
RPC -> It stands for remote procedure calls. It allow to complex data structure to be transmitted , processed & returned

we can use diff langague such as Python , Ruby , Java , PHP

odoo's Inbuild methods you can use for integration
1. search()
2. search_count()
3. search_read()
4. write()
5. fields_get()
6. read()
7. create()
8. unlink()

Odoo's custom methods too

**Need for XML - RPC**
- Odoo url
- Database name
- User & (`Password` or `API` key)

---
Steps for integration
Only two steps we need to follow
- Authentication with odoo
- Use any methods which we discussed above (it could be depends on you usage one or more calls)

```python
from xmlrpc import client
# or
import xmlrpc.client
```

Configuration

```python
url = 'http://192.168.11.21:8017'
```
- here in the url we pass the url from the address bar
- if we wnat to connect oter user's url at that time we need to pass ip of that user after http: & xmlrpc port

```python
db = 'odoo'
username = 'admin'
password = 'admin'
```
- In password we can pass the externam api whicjh is generated by user

- how to generate external api just click on user after that click on preferences & go to api keys generated it add that key into password

- create common endpoint

```python 
common = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(f'{url}/xmlrpc/common')
```
- here i am authenticating if the password is wrong iy will return false

```python
uid = common.authenticate(db,username,password,{})
# '{}' if you want to pass extra parameter then we can pass here '{}'

operation = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(f'{url}/xmlrpc/object')

list_of_parameter_ids = operation.execute_kw(db,uid,password,'res.partner',
											'search',[[['customer_rank','>',0]]])

```

#### Create method

```python
if uid:
	operation.execute_kw(db,uid,password,'res.partner','create',
						[{'name':'ramukaka'}])
```

#### Write method

```python
if uid:
	operation.execute_kw(db,uid,password,'res.partner','write',
						[[92],{'name':'rajukaka'}])
```

#### search_count method

```python
if uid:
	count = operation.execute_kw(db,uid,password,'res.partner',
								'search_count',[[['customer_rank','>',0]]])
print(count)
```

#### unlink method 

```python 
if uid:
	operations.execute_kw(db,uid,password,'res.partner','unlink',[92])
```

#### Read method

```python
customer_ids = operations.execute_kw(db,uid,password,'res.partner',
									'search',[[['customer_rank','>',0]]])

read_records = operations.execute_kw(db,uid,password,'res.partner',
									'read',[customer_ids],{'fields':['name']})
```

#### search_read method

```python
partners = operations.execute_kw(db,uid,password,'res.partner','search_read',
								[[]],{'fields':['name'],'limit'= 5})
for partner in partners:
	print(partner)
```
