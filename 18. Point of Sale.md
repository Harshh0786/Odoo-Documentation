## POS Payment Handling

Let's walk through an example to illustrate how payment handling works in Odoo's Point of Sale (POS) module:

### Example Scenario: Making a Purchase at a Retail Store

#### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Starting the Transaction:**
   - Jane, a customer, selects several items at a retail store equipped with Odoo POS. The cashier begins the checkout process by scanning each item's barcode or selecting them from the POS interface.

2. **Adding Products:**
   - Jane's items include a laptop priced at $1,200, a mouse priced at $30, and a keyboard priced at $50. The total before tax is $1,280.

3. **Choosing Payment Method:**
   - After confirming the items, Jane decides to pay with her credit card.

4. **Processing Payment:**
   - The cashier enters the total amount of $1,280 into the POS system. Jane inserts her credit card into the POS terminal's card reader.

5. **Payment Authorization:**
   - Odoo POS communicates with the payment gateway integrated with the store's system.
   - The payment gateway verifies Jane's credit card details and authorizes the transaction in real-time.

6. **Confirmation and Receipts:**
   - The POS terminal displays a confirmation screen showing the transaction's details: items purchased, total amount, and payment method (credit card).
   - Jane confirms the transaction, and Odoo POS generates a receipt.
   - The cashier offers Jane the option to receive the receipt either via email or in printed form.

7. **Handling Split Tenders (Optional):**
   - If Jane wanted to split her payment (e.g., part credit card and part cash), the cashier could accommodate this by adjusting the amounts accordingly in the POS system.

	![[handling_split_tender.png]]

8. **Integration with Backend Systems:**
   - The completed transaction details, including the items sold and payment received, are automatically synchronized with Odoo's backend.
   - Inventory levels are updated to reflect the items sold, and sales records are recorded for reporting and accounting purposes.

9. **Refunds and Returns:**
    - If Jane later decides to return the mouse due to a defect, the cashier can process a refund directly through the POS interface.
    - The refund amount is credited back to Jane's credit card, maintaining transactional accuracy.

In this example, Odoo's POS module efficiently handles the entire payment process, from selecting items to completing the transaction and ensuring seamless integration with backend operations for accurate reporting and customer satisfaction.

### POS Reporting and Analytics 

The Reporting and Analytics section in the Odoo POS module provides valuable insights into sales performance, order details, and session activities. The three sub-categories under the Reporting menu are:

1. **Orders Analysis**
2. **Sales Details**
3. **Session Report**

Let's delve into each sub-category in detail:

#### 1. Orders Analysis

**Purpose:**
Orders Analysis provides an overview and in-depth analysis of all POS orders within a specified period.

**Key Features:**
- **Filters and Grouping:** You can filter orders by date, salesperson, product, customer, and more. Grouping options allow you to analyze orders by day, week, month, etc.
- **Measures:** Key metrics such as total sales, average order value, and number of orders can be measured.
- **Graphical Representations:** Orders can be visualized using bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and pivot tables for better understanding and comparison.

**Use Case:**
For example, if Domino's wants to analyze its sales performance over the last quarter, they can set the start date and end date accordingly. They can group data by month to see monthly sales trends and identify the best-selling products or busiest times.

#### 2. Sales Details

**Purpose:**
The Sales Details report provides a detailed view of all sales transactions within a specified date range.

**Key Features:**
- **Date Range:** Select the start date and end date to focus on a specific period.
- **Detailed Breakdown:** The report includes information such as order reference, customer name, product details, quantities sold, discounts applied, and total amount.
- **Export Options:** Sales details can be exported to CSV or Excel for further analysis or record-keeping.

**Use Case:**
For instance, Domino's management can generate a Sales Details report for a particular month to audit daily transactions, track cash flows, and ensure all sales are accurately recorded. This helps in identifying any discrepancies or patterns in customer purchases.

#### 3. Session Report

**Purpose:**
The Session Report provides a summary of all activities during a specific POS session, including opening and closing balances, total sales, and cash movements.

**Key Features:**
- **Session Overview:** Displays information such as session start and end times, total sales, cash movements (cash in and cash out), and closing balance.
- **Detailed Transactions:** Breaks down the transactions conducted during the session, including payment methods used and any discrepancies noted.
- **Reconciliation:** Helps in reconciling cash at the end of each session, ensuring accuracy in cash handling.

**Use Case:**
For example, at Domino's, each shift manager can generate a Session Report at the end of their shift. This report will show the opening cash balance, all sales transactions, any cash ins (like cash received for deliveries), and cash outs (like cash used for delivery bike petrol). The closing balance can be reconciled against the physical cash in the register to ensure all transactions are accounted for.

### Example Scenario in Domino's Restaurant

**Orders Analysis:**
- **Scenario:** The regional manager of Domino's wants to analyze the sales performance for the last quarter.
- **Action:** They set the start date to April 1 and the end date to June 30. Grouping the data by month and filtering by product category (e.g., pizzas, beverages), they can identify which products sold the most and which locations performed better.

**Sales Details:**
- **Scenario:** The finance team needs a detailed report of all sales transactions for May to prepare the monthly financial statements.
- **Action:** They select the start date as May 1 and the end date as May 31. The report lists all transactions, including customer details, product names, quantities, and total sales, which can be exported to Excel for further processing.

**Session Report:**
- **Scenario:** At the end of the day, the store manager at a Domino's outlet needs to reconcile the cash register.
- **Action:** They generate the Session Report for their shift. The report shows the opening cash balance of $1000, total sales collected in cash and other payment methods, a cash in of $200 for a delivery, and a cash out of $50 for petrol expenses. The closing balance helps the manager ensure the physical cash matches the report.

These reporting and analytics tools in Odoo POS help Domino's management make data-driven decisions, monitor sales performance, ensure accurate financial records, and manage daily operations efficiently.
