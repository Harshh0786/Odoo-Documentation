### 1. Python Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (called the child or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called the parent or base class). This promotes code reusability and hierarchical class organization.

```python
# Parent class
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, my name is {self.name}."

# Child class inheriting from Person
class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, student_id):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.student_id = student_id

    def study(self, subject):
        return f"{self.name} is studying {subject}."

# Child class inheriting from Person
class Teacher(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, subject_taught):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.subject_taught = subject_taught

    def teach(self):
        return f"{self.name} teaches {self.subject_taught}."

# Usage
student = Student("Alice", 20, "S12345")
print(student.greet())  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice.
print(student.study("Math"))  # Output: Alice is studying Math.

teacher = Teacher("Mr. Smith", 35, "History")
print(teacher.greet())  # Output: Hello, my name is Mr. Smith.
print(teacher.teach())  # Output: Mr. Smith teaches History.
```

- ### Explanation:

	- **Person Class**: This is the parent class that defines basic attributes (`name` and `age`) and a `greet` method.
	
	- **Student Class** (Child of Person): Inherits from `Person` using `class Student(Person)`. It adds a new attribute `student_id` and implements a `study` method specific to students.
	
	- **Teacher Class** (Child of Person): Inherits from `Person`, adds a `subject_taught` attribute, and implements a `teach` method specific to teachers.
	
	- **Usage**: Instances of `Student` and `Teacher` are created (`student` and `teacher`), and their methods (`greet`, `study` for `student`; `greet`, `teach` for `teacher`) are accessed and printed.
	
	This example demonstrates how inheritance allows `Student` and `Teacher` to inherit common attributes and methods from `Person` while allowing each subclass to have its own unique attributes and behaviors.

### 2. Model Inheritance

Model inheritance in Odoo is used to extend or modify existing models. There are two types of model inheritance: classical inheritance and delegation inheritance.

#### Classical Inheritance

Classical inheritance is used to add or modify fields and methods of an existing model.

##### **Example:**

```python
class ResPartner(models.Model):
    _inherit = 'res.partner'
    
    new_field = fields.Char(string='New Field')
    
    def new_method(self):
        return "This is a new method"
```

In this example:

- The `res.partner` model is extended by adding a new field `new_field` and a new method `new_method`.

#### Delegation Inheritance

Delegation inheritance is used to link a new model to an existing model using a Many2one relationship.

##### **Example:**

```python
class InheritedModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'inherited.model'
    _inherits = {'res.partner': 'partner_id'}
    
    partner_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', required=True,
     ondelete='cascade')
    additional_field = fields.Char(string='Additional Field')

```

In this example:

- The `inherited.model` inherits from `res.partner` using delegation inheritance.
- The `partner_id` field establishes a Many2one relationship with `res.partner`.
---
### 3. View Inheritance

View inheritance in Odoo allows you to extend or modify existing views. This is done using `xpath` expressions to locate and manipulate elements within the view structure.

#### Example:

```xml
<odoo>
    <record id="view_partner_form_inherited"
     model="ir.ui.view">
        <field name="name">
        res.partner.form.inherited</field>
        <field name="model">res.partner</field>
        <field name="inherit_id"
         ref="base.view_partner_form"/>
        <field name="arch" type="xml">
            <xpath expr="//field[@name='name']"
             position="after">
                <field name="new_field"/>
            </xpath>
        </field>
    </record>
</odoo>
```

In this example:

- The `res.partner` form view is extended.
- A new field `new_field` is added after the `name` field using an `xpath` expression.

### Summary

- **Python Inheritance**: Used for creating new classes that inherit properties and methods from existing classes.
- **Model Inheritance**: Used for extending or modifying existing models. It can be either classical or delegation inheritance.
- **View Inheritance**: Used for extending or modifying existing views using `xpath` expressions.
