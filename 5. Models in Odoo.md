In odoo models represent the structure data entites that are used to store and manage information within the system in simple word it represent the database table

Models in odoo are defined using python classes and that are typically associcated with database table

Models in odoo are defined as python classes that inherit from the base model class which is provided by the odoo framework the model class defines as structure and behaviour of data entity

```python
from odoo import models,fields

class Product(models.Model):
	_name  = 'product.product'
	_description = 'Product Information'

	name = fields.Char(string='Name', required=True)
	description = fields.Text(string='Description')
	price = fields.Float(string='Price)
	quantity = fields.Integer(string='Quantity')
```

Here we have define a custom module in odoo  typically  i have created a python class that inherits from `"models.Model"` bu inheriting from base class,your custom model inherits various functionalities & features provided by odoo such as access control, record manipulation methods.

### Model attributes

`_name`: specifies the technical name of the model must be unique within the odoo system so this techincal name is used internally within odoo for various purpose such as database table, XML file references  & python references

`_description`: It is used to provide human readable description or label for the model. This description typically used for documentation purpose & is displayed in various user interfaces within the odoo system to help users to understand the purpose or nature of the model.

### FIelds

Fields are attributes of the model class that define the structure of the database table odoo provides various field types such as char, Integer, Float,Text,Boolean, Date, Datetime etc.

```python
name = fields.Char(string = 'Name', required = True)
```

Each field model can have various properties such as string (`it is used for fields labels`), required (`whether the field is madatory`), default(`if user did not enter the value for that field it sets default value`) etc.

#### Simple fields

Simple fields are basic fields used to store straightforward datatypes such as strings, integers, floats, boolean, dates & Times.

1. **Charfield** :- used to store short to medium lengths strings.
```python
name = fields.Char(string = 'Name', required = True)
```

2. **Textfield** :- used to store longer text strings
```python
description = fields.Text(string = 'Description')
```

3. **Booleanfield** :- used to store boolean values.
```python
is_active = fields.Boolean(string = 'Active', default = True)
```

4. **Floatfield** :- used to store floating point numbers (decimals)
```python
price = fields.Float(string = 'Price')
```

5. **Datefield** :- used to store dates.
```python
date = fields.Date(string = 'Date')
```

6. **Datetimefield** :- used to store date & time values
```python
datetime = fields.Datetime(sting = 'Val')
```

7. **Selectionfield** :- A selection field allows you to define a list of options from which a user can choose. Each option is a tuple consisting of a value and a label.
```python
status = fields.Selection(
	[ ('draft', 'Draft'), 
	  ('confirmed', 'Confirmed'), 
	  ('done', 'Done'), 
	  ('cancelled', 'Cancelled') ],
	 string='Status', default='draft')
```

8. **Monetaryfield** :- A monetary field is used to handle currency values. It is similar to a float field but is specifically designed for handling monetary amounts along with a currency.
```python
amount = fields.Monetary( string='Amount', currency_field =    'currency_id') 
currency_id = fields.Many2one('res.currency', string='Currency')
```

#### Automatic (`Magic Fields`) 

In odoo automatic fields sometimes referred to as `"magic"` fields these are special fields that automatically compute or manage certain values compute
based on predefined  logic. These field can be very helpful for automatically updating information without requiring manual interventation.

1. Create Date & time (`create_date`)
	- This field automatically records the date & time when a record is created
2. Last updated Date & time (`write_uid`)
	- This field automatically records the date & time when record is last updated
3. `create_uid`
	- This field stores the user ID of the user who created the record
4. `write_uid`
	- This field stores the user ID of the user who last modified the record.
5. Compute fields
	- Computed fields are custom fields that  are automatically calculated based on the values of others field or external field.
```python
total_price = fields.Float(string = 'Total Price', 
						   compute = '_compute_total_price')

def _compute_total_price(self):
	for record in self:
		record.total_price = record.quantity * record.price
```

#### Relational fields in odoo

Relational fields are used to establish relationship between diff models in the database.

#### Types :-
- Many2one
- One2many
- Many2many

### Many2one 
- Many2one field establish many to one relationship between two models
- It is used when each record in one model can be associated with only one record in another model.

`Ex`: A sales order belongs to one customer
```python
customer_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', 
							  string = 'Customer')
```
### One2many
- One2many field establish one to many relationship between two models.
- It is used when each record in one model can be associated with multiple record in another model.

`Ex`: Company and Employee, One company has multiple employee but one employee has only one company

`Employee model`
```python
from odoo import fields, models

class Employee(models.Model):
	_name = 'demo.employee'
	_description = 'Employee'
	
	company_id = fields.Many2one('demo.company', 
							  string = 'Company')
```

`company model`
```python
from odoo import fields, models

class Company(models.Model):
	_name = 'demo.company'
	_description = 'Company'

	name = fields.Char(string = 'Company Name')
	employee_ids = fields.One2many('demo.employee','company_id', 
									string = 'Employee Recors')
```

### Many2many
- Many2many field establish many2many relationship between two models its is used when each record in one model can be associated with multiple records in another model and visa  versa.

`Ex`: A product can belong to multiple categories and each category has multiple products

`Product model`
```python
from odoo import fields, models

class Product(models.Model):
	_name : 'product.product'
	_description : 'product'

	name = fields.Char(string = 'Product')
	catergory_ids = fields.Many2many('product.category', 
									string = 'Categories')
```

`Category model`
```python
from odoo import fields, models

class ProductCategory(models.Model):
	_name : 'product.category'
	_description : 'Product category'

	name = fields.Char(string = 'Category')
	product_ids = fields.Many2many('product.product', 
									string = 'Product Details')
```
